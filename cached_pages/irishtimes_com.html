The law that provides for tribunals seeks to balance their purpose – fact-finding and reporting on matters of legitimate and substantial public concern – with the right of a person, corporation or other entity, to be left alone. Tribunals of inquiry can compel the production of documents and the giving of evidence relevant to their terms of reference. To compensate for the huge interference this entails, the evidence collected by tribunals cannot be used in the criminal courts. If the discoveries of tribunals lead to criminal investigations, gardaí must collect their own evidence for potential production in court. A tribunal can express an opinion on the evidence it collects, whereas a criminal conviction requires that a charge be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

It can lower blood pressure and heart rate and improve cardiac health. Time spent regularly in nature can increase your pain threshold, improve biological functions and boost energy, feelings of vigour and vitality. Time in nature also enhances empathy, compassion and altruism. It strengthens your sense of connection to the natural world, while fostering feelings of awe and transcendence. Yūgen is a Japanese term that translates as “mysterious profundity”, an intuitive feeling of how nature can encapsulate you in a transcendent way, not easily expressed in words. It is a sort of imaginative sixth sense that enables time in nature to inspire new ideas, boost creativity and shift perspectives.","type":"text"},{"_id":"TYBRJZBH25CUTPQRXX3YKB5BSQ","additional_properties":{"_id":"766J3EVDZFCHXIKL4ZSOFXJF3I"},"content":"25 ways to improve your health in 2025: Shop less, sleep more and keep a good work-life balance","type":"interstitial_link"},{"_id":"MPCCN2OJ7FDEHKGF326OLEQ7TM","additional_properties":{"_id":1736352157131},"content":"Make time for awe","type":"header"},{"_id":"JZWMHDLQHRFCPPUHZE6GICIC4I","additional_properties":{"_id":1736352157132},"content":"Awe isn’t limited to once-in-a-lifetime moments; it can be found in everyday experiences.

Unfortunately, that has been very much damaged by the amount of stuff that’s in the soil systems. That’s not just in Co Mayo, it’s around the whole country. Lough Carra is going through a bit of a revival now, hopefully, because there’s a whole project involving scientists and farmers to try and revive it. Being out on the Carra is so different because the limestone base makes it beautiful and green. And the water was so clear and it was almost idyllic.

Who’ll be performing at the ceremony? Definitely not Bruce or Gaga, but there’s bound to be a few right-leaning country singers lined up.","type":"text"},{"_id":"KHYXYNJR2BFLVBDEWAB7AXLBSA","additional_properties":{"_id":"KAPBTZSOHNCKLJHFZCR2USTPCE"},"type":"image"},{"_id":"XXPSO7CY5VGQXBWIMZ62DDWIE4","additional_properties":{"_id":1736526180486},"content":"Video Nasty","type":"header"},{"_id":"TD4MX3SPGBGYPPPAOSRSZVXMEQ","additional_properties":{"_id":1736526180487},"content":"Monday, Virgin Media One, 9pm","type":"header"},{"_id":"LILXYG7YFJGNNDIKHJXJF43ZIM","additional_properties":{"_id":1736526180488},"content":"We missed this when it aired on BBC earlier this month, but now Virgin Media One are bringing us back to the 1980s with this comedy-horror series set in the world of cheap cult horror and slasher videos.

Abbott plays a young dad who starts to turn hairy while sheltering with wife and child in the woods. The film is most remarkable for its focus on the protagonist’s experiences as his body gets taken over by lupine influences. His sense of smell heightens. Vision alters dramatically. His understanding of human speech falters. Whannell’s risky focus on the psychological over the physical may alienate some gorehounds, but it makes for an original shocker with subtexts that linger. <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/01/15/wolf-man-review-shocker-finds-new-ways-of-turning-the-stomach-as-it-honours-the-great-werewolf-tradition/\" target=\"_blank\">Full review</a> <b>DC</b>","type":"text"},{"_id":"QFF7MFM7NJCLHBWXMAQJLJDR3E","additional_properties":{"_id":1737015587367},"content":"Pepe ★★★★☆","type":"text"},{"_id":"NWEYONE3MZEOXEBTJHFXW7VWUY","additional_properties":{"_id":"Z6LWGZR2B5F4TEJDOR6ACGSLXE"},"type":"image"},{"_id":"KE4ETOH4QZH4DF76MAOCXAVNZM","additional_properties":{},"content":"<i>Directed by Nelson Carlo De Los Santos Arias.

That’s too hard to ignore, even when Renault layers the sentimentality. The Renault will be a sales hit for those who rarely use the rear seats. It will certainly eat into Mini’s market, that other merchant of the retro trope.

When the model was first launched 2003, it was absolutely the ugly duckling of the BMW range.

It was pretty awful.","type":"text"},{"_id":"FOTVHH4C3JFTNNBD46RRU2BWAQ","additional_properties":{"_id":1735048034111},"content":"The second and third generations fixed most of that, but did so with a dash of conservatism.

I borrowed a last-gen X3 2.0-litre diesel for a family holiday a couple of years back, and reached the end of the 10 days not wanting to give it back. Anyone who knows my general disdain for SUVs might find that surprising, but the X3 was a beacon of comfort and quietness during a somewhat fraught vacation – it was roomy, it was seriously beautifully made inside, it was comfortable and silent, it did 50mpg all day long, and it was fun to drive on the rare stretches of twisty road that we found.","type":"text"},{"_id":"AV5EOICBABB3PI5DQT5XHWSH7U","additional_properties":{"_id":1735048034113},"content":"So this new X3 has some fairly big shoes to fill, at least in my mind, but it’s getting off to a very good start with how it looks. Now, the last few years of BMW design, the last few decades, depending on who you listen to, have been Marmite-y at best.

The new X3, mechanically speaking, sits on the cusp of electrification – it does come with a new long-range plug-in hybrid, and the next-generation electric iX3 will be the debut car for BMW’s all-singing-and-dancing Neue Klasse EV chassis – and so its style kind of mixes a bit of the conservatism of old, with some of the blocky, monolithic detailing that will become more overt on that Neue Klasse all-electric car.","type":"text"},{"_id":"5SWJ2EQAA5DKHECU5K4ND5YJ74","additional_properties":{"_id":1735048034115},"content":"It’s not entirely successful, but in the glowering black paint of our test car, I think it looks rather good.

If the old X3 had a perfectly wrought conventional car cabin, the new X3 is aiming for the bleachers, so to speak. The big twinned digital screens that stretch across the dashboard are familiar now, and broadly good to use (still, though, more physical buttons would be welcome) but the huge, bulging, fabric-covered expanse in front of the passenger’s side – clad in a material made from recycled PET bottles no less – looks almost like a modern art installation. It’s set off by light-up bars, taken from the 5 Series and 7 Series, which now stretch into the door panels.

Maximum power is 197hp and there’s a useful 400Nm of torque, while CO2 emissions are a relatively steep 153g/km as standard, and 160g/km for this particular model, thanks to its optional 20in alloy wheels.","type":"text"},{"_id":"KQXYGGB6VBCQDBJJY6PRUJYMUM","additional_properties":{"_id":1735048034119},"content":"Performance is relaxed – there’s a reasonable low-down thump from that 400Nm, but in an age of incredibly accelerative electric cars, the X3 20d feels almost languid.
