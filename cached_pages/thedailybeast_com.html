Hines will join her husband at President-elect Donald Trump’s second inauguration in Washington, D.C., and plans to walk the red carpet for the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) ball, the first event of its kind. In November, Kennedy was nominated to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services after his failed attempt at running for president himself, putting his spin on Trump’s motto: MAHA. Hines, a two-time Emmy Award nominee, has joined Kennedy at multiple MAGA-themed shindigs at Mar-a-Lago including Trump’s election night watch party. Kennedy, who has yet to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, faces an uphill battle to join the Trump administration due to his past medical views. One letter against his appointment was signed by 15,000 doctors asking the Senate to block Kennedy as health secretary. “RFK Jr. is not only unqualified to lead this essential agency,” the letter read. “He is actively dangerous.”","type":"text"},{"_id":"FFLU7YFSGVFWRM65KDJG6MEX7A","additional_properties":{},"content":"","type":"text"},{"_id":"FEGC5LSQJRFWPPU7CM22GM2EZQ","additional_properties":{},"content":"","type":"text"}],"subheadlines":{"basic":"Hines, a two-time Emmy Award nominee, has joined Kennedy at multiple shindigs at Mar-a-Lago including Trump’s election night watch party."}},{"_id":"X3FSXC2ESZASRJ7UG5DJ7G2WBQ","canonical_website":"thedailybeast","copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-01-19T16:20:40.378Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"OXC6CUNAWZJ5LALTKZ3AVUOCYQ","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Sean Craig","org":null,"image":{"url":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/7026a2b2-3953-450c-af31-00e4c1195fe9.png","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"b16925a73b135b3ac3c17642a404304d753fd5be9e7a4762dce1a4b6331b35a5"}},"description":"","slug":"sean-craig","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":"sean.craig@thedailybeast.com"},{"site":"facebook","url":null},{"site":"linkedin","url":null}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":"sean.craig@thedailybeast.com","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"facebook","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"linkedin","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"OXC6CUNAWZJ5LALTKZ3AVUOCYQ","type":"author","version":"0.10.10","slug":"sean-craig","byline":"Sean Craig","firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Craig","image":"https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/7026a2b2-3953-450c-af31-00e4c1195fe9.png","expertise":null,"location":null,"role":null,"email":"sean.craig@thedailybeast.com","facebook":null,"bio":"","longBio":"<p>Sean Craig is a reporter in Berlin.

It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW,” the president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform. Those interested were directed to <a href=\"https://gettrumpmemes.com/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://gettrumpmemes.com/\">gettrumpmemes.com</a> to purchase. According to the site, the meme features an image of Trump with his fist in the air emblazoned with his now-famous “FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,” popularized after the first failed assassination attempt against him. “His strength and courage ignited a movement becoming the most memorable meme of the century,” the site boasts. It also describes him as “the crypto president.” Trump’s foray into the meme coin space isn’t a big shock given his promises to prioritize cryptocurrency under his new administration. On Saturday, $TRUMP trended on X, with users buzzing about the coin.","type":"text"},{"type":"oembed_response","subtype":"twitter","_id":"AXHW2T5CZRGI5LWOEM2FRA5OUY","raw_oembed":{"url":"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386","author_name":"Donald J.

months after his girlfriend’s death, 94-year-old Clint Eastwood is “doing good,” according to his son. Eastwood’s girlfriend, Christina Sandera, 61, died of a heart attack in July. The two had been dating for 10 years. At the time, Eastwood said: “Christina was a lovely, caring woman, and I will miss her very much.” His son, Scott, told <a href=\"https://people.com/clint-eastwood-doing-good-after-girlfriends-death-son-scott-exclusive-8774597\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://people.com/clint-eastwood-doing-good-after-girlfriends-death-son-scott-exclusive-8774597\">PEOPLE</a> that the legendary director and actor was a “survivor, a trooper.” Sandera died just two days after her 61st birthday in a Monterey County, California, hospital. She was a board member of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Foundation, which paid tribute to her at the time of her death on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C9qFKiEy1Ct/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=5867939a-583e-4a22-ab3e-d413869952a2\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" title=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C9qFKiEy1Ct/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=5867939a-583e-4a22-ab3e-d413869952a2\">Instagram</a>. “Despite being connected to high-profile celebrity life, Christina often eschewed the spotlight. She was far more comfortable in her jeans, pigtails, and baseball hat, shoveling and tending to her beloved horses and animals.” Scott said of his father that it was in their blood to “just do.” He said his father “was born coming out of the Great Depression, and then he was young during World War II. He saw a lot of struggle… There is no room for complaining.”","type":"text"}],"subheadlines":{"basic":"At the time of her death, Eastwood said: “Christina was a lovely, caring woman, and I will miss her very much.”"}},{"_id":"VTE4NUXORJDFTLOGJHVC5DYWZM","canonical_website":"thedailybeast","copyright":"editorial","created_date":"2025-01-17T21:19:32.764Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"IMA6LX2FRZPARK65N4VW7VH7AE","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Amethyst Martinez","org":null,"image":{"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/Z2JKWQM3BJNCHEJRTHEOA6MKHA.jpg","version":"0.5.8","type":"image","auth":{"1":"13a0aae4a5e42659b3f6766efcaadda5a5fd0af28cfada6ba92f7ebd9fc73cdd"}},"description":"","slug":"amethyst-martinez","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":null},{"site":"facebook","url":null},{"site":"twitter","url":null},{"site":"linkedin","url":null}],"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"facebook","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"twitter","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."},{"site":"linkedin","url":null,"deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links."}],"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"IMA6LX2FRZPARK65N4VW7VH7AE","type":"author","version":"0.10.10","slug":"amethyst-martinez","byline":"Amethyst Martinez","firstName":"Amethyst","lastName":"Martinez","image":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/Z2JKWQM3BJNCHEJRTHEOA6MKHA.jpg","expertise":null,"location":null,"role":"Breaking News Intern","email":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"bio":"","longBio":"","last_updated_date":"2024-10-17T06:23:41.714Z","author_type":"freelance","linkedin":null,"books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[],"awards":[],"ansImage":{"type":"image","url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/Z2JKWQM3BJNCHEJRTHEOA6MKHA.jpg","auth":{"1":"13a0aae4a5e42659b3f6766efcaadda5a5fd0af28cfada6ba92f7ebd9fc73cdd"}}}}}]},"display_date":"2025-01-17T21:38:12.252Z","first_publish_date":"2025-01-17T21:38:12.252Z","headlines":{"basic":"Tennis Star Says Her Trophies Were Stolen After L.A.
