With 3D printing, customers can order spare parts locally, or even manufacture parts themselves, instead of ordering from far-flung, cross-ocean sources. This capability speeds up delivery and reduces the impact of supply chain disruptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn late 2020, the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, installed a Xerox ElemX 3D Printer, to explore manufacturing parts at sea. The goal is to install a printer on a Navy ship, so sailors in remote areas can fix or replace parts on demand instead of carrying excess inventory or having to send a plane to the middle of the ocean to bring the spare parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back office, by automating processes such as procure-to-pay and quote-to-cash, the Xerox 3D printing team \u0026ldquo;gained the ability to transact right out of the gate,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s no waiting to generate invoices and start collecting revenue, and we\u0026rsquo;re able to scale as much as needed. We can replicate this process for any new venture. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to implement a different platform every time we launch.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Xerox businesses grow, Oracle Cloud EPM consolidates and connects data to help the company evaluate financial performance across the portfolio. \u0026ldquo;We can look under the hood to see how each business is doing, and compare it to other units,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;What do their financials look like?

When sensors detect a problem, field technicians are automatically alerted to investigate. Such real-time responses let bridge operators and owners decide whether a bridge is being over- or underutilized, or has structural problems that need repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a key partner supporting Xerox, Oracle \u0026ldquo;has come up with a lot of creative ideas to keep things moving forward,\u0026rdquo; Vaidyanathan says. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve been instrumental in

Leggett says this benefit helped the chain be more competitive in the marketplace and better manage expenses.

By eliminating many of the legacy applications, employees spend less time interacting with multiple systems and handling paperwork and more time servicing clients. The firm also moved away from the cumbersome, disconnected HR processes that left employees and job candidates frustrated and redesigned its end-to-end employee experience with Oracle Cloud HCM. At the same time, the platform gave company leaders more visibility into HR and finance with more accurate and timely data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalent management is a big focus for all organizations, and Grant Thornton gained a cutting-edge platform in Oracle Cloud HCM to support that initiative. With \u003ca href=\"https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/recruiting/\"\u003eOracle Recruiting\u003c/a\u003e, the firm can initiate a relationship with a candidate even before the application process. This improved the firm\u0026rsquo;s ability to find and recruit new talent from various sources, such as its growing university recruiting network. Plus, interested candidates who aren\u0026rsquo;t suited to a particular role can still provide information that could spark a conversation about another position that might be a better fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, Oracle Cloud HCM allowed prospects and current employees to manage onboarding tasks, proactively update their personal profiles, manage expectations against performance, and check in with managers to identify successes.

This enhanced the firm\u0026rsquo;s efforts to understand and listen to its employees. For example, the company was able to use Oracle Journeys to conduct surveys about vaccinations and manage accommodations and exemptions, deftly handling a sensitive topic. It also created value in automating the firm\u0026rsquo;s offboarding process, which previously relied on spreadsheets.
