                    <h1>Control Over Your Personal Information</h1>
                    <p>By following the instructions below, you may request The Trade Desk limit its (a) use of your personal information for targeted advertising purposes and (b) sale or sharing of your personal information. </p>
                    <p>In response to browser and device providers changing their support for identifiers currently used for advertising, such as third-party cookies and device ids, it may be possible that you have more than one identifier associated with each browser or device. To enhance the scope of your choices related to targeted advertising and sale or sharing of your personal information, you should follow each of the instructions below.</p>
    
                    <h2>Cookie Based Opt-Out</h2>
                    <p>Some things to keep in mind when using the cookie opt-out:</p>
                    <ul style="padding-left:40px">
                        <li>If you use more than one computer, browser or browser profile, you will need to opt-out of cookies on every browser you use</li>
                        <li>If you clear or delete your cookies, this will result in the deletion of your Trade Desk opt-out cookie, meaning you will need to re-set the opt-out following the deletion</li>
                        <li>Even after opting out, you may continue to receive advertising through our services, but those ads may be less relevant</li>
                        <li>After you opt-out, your browser's Trade Desk advertising cookie will be set to all zeros meaning your Trade Desk browser cookie will no longer allow us to target advertising to your interests based on this cookie</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please note that if you block or otherwise restrict cookies this can affect choices, such as The Trade Desk opt-out, that are reliant on such cookies</p>
                    <div class="opt-out" id="opt-out"><a class="button" onclick="doOptOut()">You can opt-out of targeted advertising based on The Trade Desk's browser cookie by clicking here.</a></div>
